		"Rangeland Potential": "Developed to show rangeland condition by catchment using continuous, intact grassland habitat and rangeland soil and vegetative productivity as the primary indicators of rangeland condition and quality.",
		"Catchment Potential": "Includes five component indices: Hydrologic intactness, Erosion vulnerability, Soil vulnerability, current stress, and future risk.",
		"Riparian Potential": "Includes four component indices: Riparian intactness (grass cover and perenniality), erosion vulnerability, and drought vulnerability (based on variance in vegetation index 'greenness'), and resilience (roughly the inverse of drought vulnerability).",
